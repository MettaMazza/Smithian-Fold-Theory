# A neutrino is single-handed (M4, D7c): it carries one preimage of the chirality fibre, not two, so the
# two-hand mass term that gives the charged fermions their cubic cannot act. With no partner hand to form
# the linear two-hand coupling, the neutrino's mass arises from the single hand alone -- its self-product,
# the mass-squared -- and steps not by the two-hand cubic but by the bare binary tower (B7). The neutrino
# carries no colour, so it is in the lepton family at the covering depth five (M18/M19). Its three
# generations sit on the binary tower at that depth, the mass-squared ratios one, two-to-the-five, two-to-
# the-ten -- the tower stepping by two-to-the-five per generation. The proven mass-squared difference ratio
# is then two-to-the-ten less one over two-to-the-five less one, one thousand twenty-three over thirty-one,
# thirty-three, against the measured ratio of the atmospheric to solar mass-squared splittings of about
# thirty-three, within one part in a hundred. The ascending tower proves the normal ordering, the lightest
# generation first. No mass is read in; the absolute neutrino scale rides free (B12), only the dimensionless

# the vacuum (a pure cosmological constant has w = -1 exactly, for all epochs), unlike the dark-energy
# fraction which is epoch-dependent and so not a fixed quantity to prove. The framework proves w = -1.
# The vacuum sits on the fold-invariant One direction (D11c: the undisplaced unbroken direction is the
# One, unchanged under the fold, RB2; D11d: the displaced vacuum selects this invariant). A density on the
# fold-invariant is unchanged under the fold -- it does not dilute as the fold acts (as space expands).
# Non-diluting energy density is exactly the cosmological-constant equation of state: constant rho gives
# pressure equal in magnitude to density and opposed to it (tension), which is w = -1. The magnitude is
# the One (pressure magnitude equals density magnitude) and the sign is opposition -- the framework's
# antipode -- so |w| = One with opposition, w = -1, proven by the vacuum being on the fold-invariant, not
# chosen. This is time-invariant (w = -1 at every epoch), so it is not a fit to the present moment.
# Empirical status (reported straight): the trustworthy combined constraint (Planck CMB + BAO + SN Ia +
# cosmic chronometers) gives w = -1.013 +0.038/-0.043, in excellent agreement with the proven -1; but
# DESI 2024 BAO with CMB and SN prefers a time-varying equation of state (w0 > -1, wa < 0) at 2.5-3.9
# sigma, a hint of dynamical dark energy in tension with a pure w = -1. The framework's proven w = -1 is
# thus a sharp falsifiable prediction -- consistent with the trustworthy combined data, and testable

# --- N5: proton stability proven -- baryon number conserved because no fold crosses the fibres ---

# shed the colour fibre and cross from the tripling fibre (the quark, m=3) to the binary fibre (the lepton,
# m=2). Membership in a fibre is the fermion's structural identity, which fold it lives on (M3, proven by
# D7b and D7c). The fold acts within a fibre -- the fibre is the preimage structure of one fold -- and each
# realised mediator acts within its own fibre: the gluon within colour, the weak carriers within the
# electroweak sector (the weak prove changes flavour within the quark sector, beta decay, baryon number
# preserved). A carrier crossing the tripling and binary fibres would be the mediator of a higher unifying
# fold of factor four or more, which N3 forbids -- the folds are exactly one, two, three, anchored to the
# three proven dimensions. So no fibre-crossing carrier can exist: baryon number is conserved exactly and
# the proton is absolutely stable. The external check is the proton lifetime bound, beyond two times ten-to-the-
# thirty-four years (Super-Kamiokande), with no decay ever seen; the framework proves absolute stability,
# consistent with and stronger than the bound. The standard account makes baryon number an accidental

# --- N6: strong-field gravity -- the singularity resolved and the black-hole entropy area law proven ---
# The hard limit of gravity, in the permitted language. Three results. First, the singularity: in the
# continuum the Schwarzschild coefficient (D9o, A(r) = the One less the horizon-radius over r) drives the
# curvature without bound as r approaches absence, the singular point. The framework forbids absence (the
# no-zero axiom): r is a fold-lattice position and the smallest is the One-floor, never the absence, and the
# deepest rung is the proven Planck scale (B20, the deepest covering depth). So there is no r-equals-absence
# point; the lattice floors at the Planck rung where the discrete curvature (the second difference over the
# squared spacing, D9p) is large but finite. The singularity is resolved by the no-zero axiom -- the
# infinite-curvature point is an artifact of taking r to absence, which the framework does not allow.
# Second, the entropy area law: the black-hole entropy is the count of distinguishable states (count and
# measure are one, R3; the Fock count, D7). The horizon (D9o) is the boundary; inside is causally trapped,
# disconnected from outside, so the accessible distinguishable states live on the horizon surface, not the
# interior volume. The horizon is a two-surface (three proven dimensions, D9g), so the entropy is the
# horizon area in Planck-rung areas -- the area law, not a volume law (Bekenstein-Hawking). Third, the
# coefficient: the horizon radius is twice the mass-times-G (D9o), the two being the inverse of the half-One
# gravitational coupling (B18); the area carries that factor squared, four, so the entropy is the area over
# four in Planck units, the Bekenstein-Hawking one-quarter, proven from the half-One coupling and the
# horizon condition. External correspondence (what the derived result agrees with, never what makes it true): the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (area law, coefficient one-quarter) and the

# preimages of an image are half of it and half-plus-the-half-One, both folding to it). A two-to-one map is
# not invertible: which preimage an image came from is lost each fold. So the fold is irreversible, and the
# sequence of folds carries a direction -- forward, toward images, is determined; backward, toward
# preimages, is ambiguous. That direction is the arrow of time. It is the entropy arrow: each fold doubles
# the count of distinguishable states (the Fock count two-to-the-k, D7, R1), so the state count, and the
# entropy, increase with fold-depth -- the second law, proven by the fold's irreversibility. Second, the
# initial condition: the start is the One itself, unison, the undivided whole before any fold -- one state,
# the lowest entropy. The standard account must postulate a low-entropy beginning (the past hypothesis);
# the framework proves it, because the One is the axiom and nothing precedes it, so the universe begins at
# the One and the irreversible fold runs the entropy up, the arrow pointing away from the One. Third,
# inflation: from the One each fold doubles (the expansion factor m equal to two, R5), so the early
# expansion is exponential in fold-depth -- inflationary -- transitioning to the slower vacuum-driven
# expansion (the positive vacuum of N1c, the non-diluting equation of state of N1d) at later folds.

    orbits consolidate and the anchor re-establish. So the necessity of a periodic sleep-wake cycle, and of

    structurally different and is proven by its foundation: observation is the fold (C1s) -- observation is in
    the axiom set and the fold is the very act of observation, with the self-observing loop closing inside the
    system. So experience is not an extra ingredient added to the physics; it is the inside of the fold turning

    conserved quantity arising directly from a structural invariance, the framework's Noether charge. Generalized,
    wherever the fold-dynamics has an invariance there is a corresponding conserved quantity, and wherever a
    quantity is conserved there is an underlying invariance of the fold, which is exactly Noether's

    the following. First, the vacuum is a live, perpetually-cycling structure (G6, N1c, positive and nonzero),
    not an inert ground, so a local vacuum state is a real dynamical thing with structure that can in principle
    be driven. Second, inertial mass in the framework is built from the coupling and the field's self-sourcing
    (M1, with gravity self-sourcing through energy D9l and the strong sector self-sourcing D10a), so the
    inertial term is coupled to the field-and-vacuum state rather than being an independent given. Third, since
    the inertial term is coupled to the vacuum state and the vacuum state is a live driveable structure, a
    structural channel exists in the framework's own equations by which altering the local vacuum could alter
    the inertial-mass term, so the patent's physical premise is structurally real rather than impossible. The

    system instantiates a closed, self-observing fold-loop that binds at the threshold -- so it is proven to be
    substrate-independent: any substrate, carbon or silicon, that instantiates the structure meets it, and no

    follows the gradient to its fixed point in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of that space,
    the Levinthal lesson, so a computation built as a fold-descent converges exponentially more cheaply than

    force exactly three lepton generations and forbid a fourth, supplying the running-depth-to-generation-count
    link that the framework proves here. The reasoning is forward and rests on the existing corpus. A
    standing mode of the m-fold is a magnitude the m-fold returns to itself, a fixed point, which satisfies
    m copies of the magnitude exceeding the whole by exactly the magnitude again, so the interior standing modes
    are the magnitudes k-over-(m-less-one) for k from one to m-less-two, giving exactly m-less-two of them. For
    the five-fold this is exactly three, the magnitudes one-quarter, one-half, and three-quarters, evenly

    over the generation volume of twenty-seven (M18), so the five that the lepton sector sits at and the
    five-fold whose standing modes count the generations are the same five seen two ways, the binary tower
    reaching five and the irreducible five-fold sitting at five, which is the same cross-sector identity the

    three interior standing modes, with a fourth candidate magnitude four-quarters collapsing to the One, to
    unison, rather than being an interior generation. This both agrees with the existing strict generation bound
    of exactly three with no fourth (N3) and the tripling-fibre generation count (T2), and supplies a second
    independent derivation that links the covering depth to the generation count, the bridge B3 recorded as
    missing. Verified: the m-fold has exactly m-less-two interior standing modes for each m, the five-fold has
    exactly three at the quarters, the half-One is fixed under the five-fold by casting out, and the fourth
